# flutter_playground_expenses_app

A Flutter project built while following 
[Udemy's Flutter Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-flutter-dart-to-build-ios-android-apps/). 
It's changed from Udemy's course with some personal tweaks as well as uses latest and greatest 
Flutter and Dart and hence the code is a bit different (especially themeing, iOD interactions) from 
the course material. 

## Quick highlights

* Displays expenses in a list view
* Displays summary of last 7 days with a chart
* Add/remove transactions
* All data is stored and managed on device for now
* Responsive UI (shows more details when there is more space, e.g. on an iPad)
* Adaptive UI (iOS and Android show their own own native styles). e.g. on Android you will see a different navigation elements and floating action buttons (typical in Material design).

Here is the app running on my iPhone 12:
